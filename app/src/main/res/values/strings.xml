        "Material is the metaphor.\n\n"


        "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion.
        "
"The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet
        "
"technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.
        \n"
"Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. Th
        e "
"use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet t
        he "
"flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physi
        cal "
"world, without breaking the rules of physi
        cs.\n"
"The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects 
        move, "
"interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting
        shows "
"seams, divides space, and indicates moving part

        s.\n\n"

"Bold, graphic, intentio

        nal.\n\n"

"The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, sca
        le, color, "
"and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than
        please the "
"eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, e
        dge to edge "
"imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold
        and graphic "
"interface that immerse the user in the 
        experience.\n"
"An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent
        and provides "
"waypoints for 

        the user.\n\n"

"Motion provid

        es meaning.\n\n"

"Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary
        user actions are "
"inflection points that initiate motion, transforming t
        he whole design.\n"
"All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented t
        o the user without "
"breaking the continuity of experience even as they transfo
        rm and reorganize.\n"
"Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and 
        maintain continuity. "
"Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁci

        ent yet coheren

        t.\n\n"

"3D world.\n\n"

"The material environment is a 3D space, which means all
        objects have x, y, and z "
"dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane
        of the display, with the "
"positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of m
        aterial occupies a single "
"position along the z-axis and has 
        a standard 1dp thickness.\n"
"On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for p
        erspective. The 3D world is "
"emulated by 

        manipulating the y-axis

        .\n\n"

"Light and shadow.\n\n"

"Within the material environment, virtual lights illumin
        ate the scene. Key lights create "
"directional shadows, while ambient light creat
        es soft shadows from all angles.\n"
"Shadows in the material environment are cast by t
        hese two light sources. In Android "
"development, shadows occur when light sources a
        re blocked by sheets of material at "
"various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shad
        ows are depicted by manipulating the "
"y-axis only. The following example sho

        ws the card with a heigh

        t of 6dp.\n\n"

"Resting elevation.\n\n"

"All material objects, regardless of size, have 
        a resting elevation, or default elevation "
"that does not change. If an object changes 
        elevation, it should return to its re

        sting "
"elevation as soon 

        as possible.\n\n"

"Component elevations.\n\n"

"The resting elevation for a component type
        is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation "
"does not var
        y from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n"
"Components may have different resting ele
        vations across platforms, depending on the depth "
"of the environment (e.g., TV

        has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n\n"

"Respo

        nsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n"

"Some component types have responsive 
        elevation, meaning they change elevation in response "
"to user input (e.g., normal, fo
        cused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation "
"changes are cons
        istently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n"
"Dynamic elevation offsets are the 
        goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative "
"to the component’s resting 
        state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent "
"across actions and component t
        ypes. For example, all components that lift on press have "
"the s
        ame elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n"
"Once the input event is compl
        eted or cancelled

        , the component will return to its res

        ting "
"elevation.\n\n"

"Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n"

"Components with responsiv
        e elevations may encounter other components as they move between "
"their resting eleva
        tions and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "
"through other material,
        components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "

        "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"
"On a component level
        , components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "
"For example, a fl
        oating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen bef
        ore a "
"user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"
"On the layout lev
        el, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "
"For example, posit
        ion the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so 
    the FAB won’t interfere "
"when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"
